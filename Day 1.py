# This is a simple Python program to print a message to the screen
print("hello world")  # The print() function outputs the string "hello world" to the console
#output is : hello world


# DATA TYPES IN PYTHON
 
# 1. integer(int)
# Assign the value 10 to the variable 'a'
a = 10  

# The print() function outputs three things:
# 1. The value of 'a' (which is 10)
# 2. The type of 'a' (which is <class 'int'> because 'a' is an integer)
# 3. The unique identifier (memory address) of the object referenced by 'a'
print(a, type(a), id(a))
# output is : 10 <class 'int'> 140733056223960

# 2. float(float)
# Assign the value 5.9 to the variable 'a'
a = 5.9  

# The print() function outputs three things:
# 1. The value of 'a' (which is 5.9)
# 2. The type of 'a' (which is <class 'float'> because 'a' is a floating-point number)
# 3. The unique identifier (memory address) of the object referenced by 'a'
print(a, type(a), id(a))
# output is : 5.9 <class 'float'> 2000740303664

# 3. bollean(bool)
# true means = 1
# false means = 0
# Assign the boolean value True to the variable 'a'
a = True  

# The print() function outputs three things:
# 1. The value of 'a' (which is True)
# 2. The type of 'a' (which is <class 'bool'> because 'a' is a boolean)
# 3. The unique identifier (memory address) of the object referenced by 'a'
print(a, type(a), id(a))
